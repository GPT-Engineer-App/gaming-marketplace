# gaming-marketplace

I want to build games marketplace like steam that allows users to: 
- able to see the value proposition of the marketplace
- able to browse games
- able to buy a game (add it cart) and checkout
- able to search games by genre
- able to add a game (here you should be able to pay extra to get promoted with special visiblity)

Please mock any functionality that requires servers / APIs
